== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My scripts stopped working, what's wrong ? =

For our scripts we're using MooTools JS framework which won't work if the user is using a Prototype JS framework based plugins on his site at the same time. Also sometimes (but rarely) some jQuery scripts can cause conflicts if not running in the Compatibility Mode. Please use a FireBug or any other web developer tool to check if there's no JS conflicts on your site.

= Where are the options of the plugin ? =

RokNewsFlash is a widget, so all of the options can be found in the widget panel after placing RokNewsFlash in any position.
